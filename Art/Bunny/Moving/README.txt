The sized*.png collection should be used for regular movement/"running". All images are 800x800px.

The level*.png images are almost exactly like their sized*.png counterparts, including their sizes, however, the sprites have been angled in a way that makes both sets of legs of the bunny at the same height. They have been dragged all the way to the bottom of the images (the legs are as low on the image as they can be).
These images should be used for jumping (moving around or above an obstacle) because jumps are shaped almost like an upside-down parabola, not an upside-down V and thus the images must be angled differently at each t.
